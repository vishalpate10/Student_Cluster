**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This Streamlit app performs unsupervised clustering of students based on their academic performance using the KMeans algorithm.

---

1.Upload a dataset with academic features

2.Automatically group students into clusters

3.Visualize clusters using scatter plot, bar chart, and pie chart

**ðŸ§  Machine Learning Used**

Algorithm: KMeans Clustering

Input Features:
CGPA, Attendance_Percentage, Assignments_Completed, Lab_Score

Output: Cluster labels (0 to 3)
